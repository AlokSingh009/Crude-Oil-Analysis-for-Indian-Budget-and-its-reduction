2. Reason to Choose these Project- Every one has issue with hike in Fuel Prices with time period so I creat a analysis from 
   starting of USD price of Crude Oil to change in INR. 
3. Pandas Methods which are used in these project-: *info(),sum(),drop(), *value_counts(),*idxmax(),idxmin()
4. Graph which are used -
   Bar graph
   Pie chart
   Countplot
5. Worked Done -
   * Import all Module like Numpy, Pandas, Matplot.pyp, Warning, Seaborn, xlrd, BeautifulSoup, requests
   * By using Web Scrapping, request Module get the data from desired website 
   * By using  BeautifulSoup Module get the data in html formate and convert string data in form of list format
   * set all the data as per tabular form using DataFrame
   * now I want to do analysis only for first 20 datas

   * Suggestion for Fuel tax reduction

7. Conclusion - From above suggestion we can give suggestion to goverment to reduce taxes scale in oil fuels as per reduce as apply minimum tax 
   on oil/fuel and do respective tax recovery from non-promotional items(like- Tobacco, Alcohol items).
